#Introduction

This is a personal project to explore the beauty of Iris based on the well-known iris dataset which is commonly used to explain functionality of python or r packages.

This project is going to focus on Iris itself, understanding what Iris looks like from the dataset. I want to do this because I feel like although this data has been used so widely with various purposes, none of them wants to understand Iris itself. This feels werid to me and also unfair to Iris. 

Therefore, in a sense, I want to speak up for Iris in this project. Iris has such a beautiful name and I hope I could create something helping Iris to bring emotions to people.

I got this idea when I travelled to Toronto. When I woke up on a morning, I realized I was lying on a bed which had a sheet with flower patterns. Those flowers somehow reminded me of Iris and I went like "yeah I knew Iris since I started programming and learning data analysis beacuase it appeared in almost every tutorial of basic packages of python, such as pandas or numpy, but I still don't really know what Iris looks like. So...why not do something for Iris?" So that's where I'm coming from.
